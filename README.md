# Survey-Analysis

This repository is primarily to document the different data analysis projects I have worked in so far. These are survey data, and can be found in the linked repositories.


## About the datasets used:

1. The code [📊📝 Learning about my fellow Kagglers 📋🤯](https://github.com/booktrackerGirl/Survey-Analysis/blob/main/learning-about-my-fellow-kagglers.ipynb) corresponds to the data analysis done for the [2021 Kaggle Machine Learning & Data Science Survey](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/kaggle-survey-2021). <br><br>
<b>Description</b>: The intention of Kaggle was to conduct an industry-wide survey that presents a truly comprehensive view of the state of data science and machine learning. The survey was live from 09/01/2021 to 10/04/2021, and after cleaning the data we finished with 25,973 responses! <br><br>
<b>Objectives</b>: Primary purpose was to tell a data story about a subset of the data science community represented in this survey, through a combination of both narrative text and data exploration. A “story” could be defined any number of ways, and that’s deliberate. The challenge is to deeply explore (through data) the impact, priorities, or concerns of a specific group of data science and machine learning practitioners. That group can be defined in the macro (for example: anyone who does most of their coding in Python) or the micro (for example: female data science students studying machine learning in masters programs).

2. The code [📚🤯 Learning more about the Kaggle community 🤓🔖](https://github.com/booktrackerGirl/Survey-Analysis/blob/main/learning-more-about-the-kaggle-community.ipynb) corresponds to the data analysis done for the [2022 Kaggle Machine Learning & Data Science Survey](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/kaggle-survey-2022/). <br><br>
<b>Description</b>: The intention of Kaggle was to conduct an industry-wide survey that presents a truly comprehensive view of the state of data science and machine learning. The survey was live from 09/16/2022 to 10/16/2022, and after cleaning the data, they finished with 23,997 responses!<br><br>
<b>Objectives</b>: Primary purpose was to explore the data, and develop inferences from there. The survey results included raw numbers about who is working with data, what’s happening with machine learning in different industries, and the best ways for new data scientists to break into the field. They had published all of the data rather than only the aggregated survey results, which makes it an unusual example of a survey dataset, as it allows analysts to investigate the data on their own. And this objective resonates the previous one.
